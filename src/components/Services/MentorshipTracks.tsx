                            <strong>Real Example:</strong> Ryan was building an MVP for a data product. He needed guidance on validating his architecture and understanding commercialization strategies. We worked through his approach, refined the processes, and focused on solid foundations rather than guessing.

                            <strong>Real Example:</strong> Jake was building AI agents from scratch. He needed help choosing between AutoGPT, LangChain, and custom solutions. We discussed production patterns, context control, and how to avoid common pitfalls. He paused and resumed his subscription as needed â€” exactly when he had questions.
