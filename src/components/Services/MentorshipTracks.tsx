                            <strong>Real Example:</strong> Ryan was building an MVP for a data analysis product. He had designed the core structure but needed guidance on validation, commercialization strategies, and what would scale vs. break at 10x volume. We worked through his approach and made sure he was building on solid foundations rather than optimistic assumptions.

                            <strong>Real Example:</strong> Jake was building a multi-agent system for automated widget generation. He needed help choosing between AutoGPT, LangChain, and custom solutions. We discussed production patterns, context control, and specific issues like agent supervisors doing work themselves instead of delegating. He used the subscription flexibly â€” pausing twice (once for 2 months in Japan), resuming when questions came up.
