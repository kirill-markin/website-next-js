# My Complete Notion Task Manager: One Database for Goals, Projects & Daily Tasks

I've been chasing the perfect productivity system since I was 16, when my dad handed me a time management book and accidentally created a monster. Since then, I've been through every system you can imagine—12-week planning, monthly goals, bullet journaling, and app after app after app.

Two years ago, I finally built something that stuck. It's a single Notion table that holds everything: quarterly goals, random ideas, daily tasks, project plans. All of it. And somehow, despite managing hundreds of open items, I actually reach inbox zero most days.

Last week, my siblings saw this system in action and demanded I document it. Instead of keeping it in the family, I figured I'd share the complete setup here. This isn't another "productivity hack"—it's a battle-tested Notion task manager that's survived over a year of real-world use.

What makes it work is embarrassingly simple: everything lives in one database. No jumping between apps, no complex integrations, no task avalanches when life gets busy. Just a hierarchy that scales from life directions down to daily actions, with views that show exactly what you need to see right now.

## The Problem and Notion Solution: Why One Table Works

I've tested every productivity system under the sun—Todoist, Things, TickTick, Monday.com, Getting Things Done, bullet journaling. They all eventually failed me for the same reason: **task avalanches.**

Here's how it always went: I'd start a new system feeling optimistic. Everything got a due date. "Finish quarterly report" by March 15th. "Call dentist" by Thursday. I'd assign dates to everything because that felt organized.

Then life would happen. A busy week, a family emergency, or just getting deep into a project. I'd avoid opening my task manager for a few days.

When I finally worked up the courage to check in, I'd find 50+ overdue items staring back at me. Red badges everywhere, angry notifications, tasks screaming that they were late. The psychological weight was crushing—like opening your front door to find an avalanche of mail.

The worst part wasn't the number of tasks. It was realizing most of those "due dates" were completely arbitrary. Did I really need to call the dentist on Thursday specifically? Of course not. But the system was telling me I'd failed.

**The real problem: artificial due dates create artificial urgency, and artificial urgency trains your brain to ignore the task manager altogether.**

Date-based systems work great for tasks with genuine deadlines—paying bills, submitting reports. But they break down when you force every task into a date-shaped box. Most personal tasks are projects that need to move forward, not items that need to happen on specific days.

### The Notion Solution: One Table for Everything

The breakthrough came when I stopped organizing different types of work in different places. Instead of separate apps for goals, tasks, and projects, I built everything in a single Notion database. Life directions, quarterly goals, project ideas, daily tasks, random thoughts—all of it lives in one table.

This sounds chaotic until you see it in action. The secret is that Notion lets you structure data however you want, then view it however you need. Same information, infinite perspectives.

**Why multiple apps fail:**
- **Context switching kills momentum** - jumping between apps breaks focus
- **Information gets siloed** - can't see how daily work connects to bigger goals  
- **Systems drift apart** - connections break down over time

**My Notion solution:** Everything lives in the same database with different "Type" fields. A quarterly goal is Type = "Goal". A daily task is Type = "Task". A life direction is Type = "Direction". Same table, different labels.

Because everything lives in one database, I can create parent-child relationships. Tasks belong to projects. Projects support goals. Goals serve life directions. It's a hierarchy that reflects how work actually flows.

**How one table scales with hundreds of tasks:** Notion's database views act like smart filters. I'm never looking at hundreds of tasks—just the slice I need right now. The hierarchy creates natural boundaries. Each project has 5-15 tasks. Each life direction has 3-5 projects. Numbers stay manageable.

**Sort positions replace due dates.** Within each parent task, I assign S0 (highest priority) to S4 (lowest priority). When working on website tasks, I see 8 tasks in clear priority order, not 40 random items.

This approach scales because it mirrors how your brain works. You don't think about every task simultaneously—you think about the current project, today's priorities, or this quarter's goals. The system gives you natural focus while keeping everything connected.

## Setting Up Your Notion Task System

The foundation is a clear hierarchy: Life Directions → Quarterly Goals → Projects → Tasks. Everything starts with big-picture life directions, gets focused into quarterly goals, then breaks down into specific projects and daily tasks.

The magic happens because this hierarchy lives in a single Notion database with parent-child relationships. A task to "record YouTube video" belongs to "YouTube Channel Growth" project, which supports "upload seven training videos" goal, which serves "Mental: Continuous learning" life direction.

When everything connects like this, you never lose sight of why you're doing what you're doing.

### Life Directions and Quarterly Goals

**Life Directions** are the foundation—five ongoing areas that matter long-term, adapted from Sahil Bloom's ["5 Types of Wealth"](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-5-Types-of-Wealth-Audiobook/B0D5ZJ2GN9):

**Time:** Have the system and free time  
**Mental:** Continuous learning and growth  
**Body:** Physical health and energy  
**Social:** Relationships and community  
**Finances:** Support my level of life  

Each gets its own emoji and color tag for instant visual recognition. I create one entry per direction with Type = "Direction" in my Notion database. These become parent containers for everything else.

**Quarterly Goals:** One major goal per life direction. Not five goals per direction—one specific, measurable target that I can track weekly. Examples: "Upload 7 training videos" (Mental), "3 workouts per week" (Body), "Maximum X work hours weekly" (Time).

Each goal gets Type = "Goal", belongs to its life direction, and includes a Progress percentage field updated weekly using the 8% system (12 weeks = ~8% per week).

### Parent-Child Task Relationships in Notion

The real power of this Notion task hierarchy comes from parent-child relationships that can go up to seven levels deep. Every task, project, and goal has a clear place in the structure, and nothing exists in isolation.

You can think of it as a rough hierarchy like this, but the reality is much more fluid. There's no strict rule about where a goal ends and a task begins—the important thing is that everything gets grouped somehow. If something feels too big, I break it down into smaller pieces. If something feels scattered, I group it under a bigger container. Everything eventually connects back to one of my five life directions.

**Life Directions:** Time, Mental, Body, Social, Finances (these stay pretty stable)  
**Quarterly Goals:** One major target per direction (these change every 3 months)  
**Projects:** Whatever supports the goals (these come and go as needed)  
**Tasks:** The actual work to be done (these get broken down as much as necessary)  
**Subtasks:** When individual tasks are still too big to tackle in one sitting

For example, my YouTube goal has spawned several projects: "Training Video Production," "Channel Analytics Review," and "Equipment Upgrades." Under "Training Video Production," I have task groups like "Cursor IDE Series" and "Notion Productivity Series." Under "Cursor IDE Series," individual tasks include "Record setup walkthrough," "Edit video," "Write description," and "Create thumbnail."

The parent-child system works through Notion's relation property. Every database entry has a "Parent" field that links to another entry in the same database. This creates the tree structure without needing separate tables or complex formulas.

**Sort positions control priority within each parent.** I assign every item a sort position from S0 (highest priority) to S4 (lowest priority). This means when I'm looking at my YouTube project, I see tasks in clear priority order, not random chronological order.

**The hierarchy provides context for every task.** When I'm working on "Record setup walkthrough," I can see that it belongs to "Cursor IDE Series," which supports "Training Video Production," which feeds into my quarterly goal of "upload seven more training videos," which serves my "Mental" life direction. The connection is always visible.

This structure eliminates the common productivity problem of working on tasks that feel important but don't actually advance your bigger objectives. Every task in my system has a clear path back to one of my five life directions.

## Setting Up the Core Database Structure in Notion

This system runs on a simple Notion database with eight essential properties:

**Parent (Relation):** Creates the hierarchy by linking to other entries  
**Type (Select):** Direction, Goal, Task  
**Status (Select):** Active, Complete, Periodic  
**Sort Position (Select):** S0-S4 (priority within parent)  
**Action Date (Date):** Used sparingly for genuine deadlines  
**Priority (Select):** P0-P4 (daily execution order)  
**Progress (Number):** Percentage for quarterly goals  
**Size (Select):** Complexity estimation

Different entry types use different combinations of these properties. Directions need only Type and Sort Position. Goals use Parent, Progress, and target dates. Tasks might use everything.

#### Task Type and Status Configuration

**Type field** organizes everything in one table:
- **Direction:** Life areas (Time, Mental, Body, Social, Finances)
- **Goal:** Quarterly targets with Progress tracking
- **Task:** Projects, individual tasks, ideas, recurring items

**Status field** has three states:
- **Active:** Currently relevant items
- **Complete:** Finished items kept for reference
- **Periodic:** Recurring tasks that cycle forward instead of completing

#### Priority vs Sort Position: When to Use Each

**Sort Position (S0-S4)** is almost always filled and controls order within parent containers. Every task gets positioned relative to its siblings—S0 appears first, S4 last. This replaces traditional due dates and never "piles up."

**Priority (P0-P4)** is almost always empty and only gets filled during daily execution when multiple tasks compete for attention on the same day.

Key insight: I moved from date-driven to sort-driven task management. Instead of choosing when to do tasks (creating overwhelming daily piles), I choose their order within projects.

**Sort Position = "Where does this belong in the project?"** (always filled)  
**Priority = "What should I do first today?"** (rarely filled)

#### Action Date Setup and Daily Automation

I avoid action dates unless genuinely necessary. Only assign them to:
- Real external deadlines (bills, meetings, travel)
- Periodic maintenance tasks (weekly reviews, communication cleanup)
- Specific daily commitments

Most tasks live without action dates, organized by Sort Position within projects. A daily automation moves any overdue tasks to today's date, preventing guilt-inducing buildups of "late" items.

### The Sort Position System (S0-S4) for Task Prioritization

I prioritize tasks only relative to siblings within the same parent container:

**S0:** Critical path items (1-3 per project maximum)  
**S1:** Important for project success  
**S2:** Normal priority, supporting tasks  
**S3:** Nice to have  
**S4:** Someday/maybe ideas

This scales naturally—whether a project has 5 or 50 tasks, I'm only answering: "Relative to other tasks in this project, how important is this one?" When ready to work, I open the project and tackle tasks in S0-S4 order.

### Status Fields and Progress Tracking Setup

**Status field** handles individual tasks: Active items appear in working views, Complete items are preserved but hidden, Periodic items cycle forward with updated dates.

**Progress field** tracks quarterly goals using 8% weekly increments (12 weeks = ~8% per week). Every Friday, I update based on actual advancement and spot goals falling behind.

**Size field** estimates complexity:
- **Moment/Small:** Quick tasks or single-session work
- **Medium/Big:** Multi-session or complex tasks  
- **sshshshshshsh:** Tasks I really don't want to do

This setup matches tasks to available energy and creates a sophisticated system where every property serves a specific purpose.

## My Daily Workflow: Inbox Zero Without the Overwhelm

I add 10-20 new tasks daily yet reach inbox zero most days. The secret: two separate workflows. Capturing is thoughtless—brain dump everything into the inbox. Processing is intentional—once daily, assign everything a proper home in the hierarchy.

This separation prevents the common failures: either over-complicating capture (losing ideas) or under-processing captured items (creating digital chaos).

### Quick Task Capture Workflow in Notion

Task capture takes literally two clicks from anywhere. Key insight: capture and organization are different mental modes. During capture, I just want thoughts out of my head—no categorization decisions.

**Setup:**
- **Phone:** Notion widget + Siri shortcuts for voice capture
- **Computer:** Pinned browser tab to database "Add New" view

Every idea goes straight to inbox with just the title. No parent, no priority, no date—just the raw thought. I'd rather have 20 messy inbox items than lose 3 good ideas to an overcomplicated system.

### Processing Your Notion Inbox Daily

Daily processing takes 10-15 minutes, even with 20 new items. For each captured idea, I ask three questions using the Jobs to Be Done framework:

**1. Which life direction?** Time, Mental, Body, Social, or Finances. 90% of tasks have obvious homes.

**2. Standalone task or project component?** Individual tasks get assigned directly. Project ideas get containers first, then broken down.

**3. What's its priority relative to similar tasks?** Assign sort position (S0-S4) within the parent container.

I almost never assign action dates during processing—that's intentional and crucial for system sustainability.

### Why I Avoid Due Dates in My Task Management System

Artificial due dates create artificial urgency, which trains your brain to ignore the task manager. Most personal tasks ("Update LinkedIn," "Learn Spanish") don't have real deadlines. Assigning arbitrary dates creates guilt when they pass and conditions you to ignore all deadlines.

I only assign action dates to:
- **Real external deadlines:** Bills, meetings, travel
- **Periodic maintenance:** Weekly reviews, communication cleanup  
- **Deliberate daily planning:** Conscious tomorrow commitments

Everything else lives in the hierarchy by sort position. This eliminates task avalanches—I never see 50 "overdue" items because most tasks don't have dates.

Weekly cleanup: I scan action dates and ask "Does this really need a specific date?" Usually no. The few dated tasks (3-7 daily) become my minimum obligations. Then I freely navigate the hierarchy based on energy and sort positions.

## Essential Notion Views That Make This System Manageable

You're never staring at hundreds of tasks simultaneously. Smart database views filter the same data for different purposes: daily execution, tomorrow planning, inbox processing, goal tracking, and project work.

These views auto-sync—complete a task in "Active" view and it disappears from "Tomorrow" too. Process an inbox item and it immediately appears in the right project view. One database, multiple perspectives, zero maintenance.

### Active Tasks View Setup

My daily command center shows only tasks that genuinely need attention today—usually 3-7 carefully chosen items instead of 50+ overwhelming possibilities.

**Filter setup:**
- Status: Active
- Action Date: Today or earlier

Simple but powerful. Everything else stays hidden until I deliberately navigate to those projects. This creates psychological focus: a manageable list of real commitments, not an overwhelming pile of possibilities.

#### Tree Structure vs Flat View Options

Toggle between tree and flat views with one click to match your mental state:

**Tree View:** Shows hierarchy and context. Perfect for understanding why tasks matter and making smart substitutions when plans change.

**Flat View:** Simple checklist without nesting. "Execution mode" for knocking out commitments efficiently without distractions.

Strategic thinking? Tree view. Focused execution? Flat view. Same data, different cognitive modes.

### Tomorrow Planning View Configuration

End each day with deliberate planning instead of stumbling into tomorrow wondering what to work on. I promote 3-7 tasks from "project priority order" to "time-specific commitment."

**Two views with identical filters (Status: Active, Action Date: Tomorrow):**

**Tomorrow (Tree):** Evening planning with hierarchical context to see how tasks connect to bigger projects.

**Tomorrow Flat:** Morning execution with simple checklist—no hierarchy distractions.

This prevents both under-planning (aimless project wandering) and over-planning (impossible guilt-breeding lists).

#### Managing Task Priorities for Next Day

During evening planning, assign Priority (P0-P4) to tomorrow's tasks for execution order:

**P0:** Must happen first (usually one item)  
**P1:** Should happen early (fresh energy tasks)  
**P2:** Normal priority (most planned tasks)  
**P3:** If time permits  
**P4:** Last resort

Priority only matters within a single day—not ranking every system task, just tomorrow's small committed list. Next morning: open Tomorrow Flat view, sort by Priority, work P0 to P4.

### Inbox Processing View for New Tasks

The Inbox view captures the raw brain dump from daily idea capture, then processes everything to zero once daily (10-15 minutes, even with 15-20 items).

**Filter:** Parent is empty

If it doesn't have a parent, it needs processing. When I assign a parent during processing, items automatically disappear from Inbox and appear in appropriate project views.

**Additional filter during processing:** Created: Past week

This focuses on fresh captures. Older items get handled during weekly reviews, keeping daily processing efficient and focused.

## The Jobs to Be Done Approach: Processing Tasks Like a Pro

I adapted the Jobs to Be Done framework for inbox processing: "What job am I hiring this task to do in my life?" This shifts thinking from "Where does this go?" to "What outcome should this create?"

This transforms processing from administrative chore to strategic work—deciding how to allocate attention across competing priorities. When you capture "learn Spanish," JTBD reveals the real motivation (cultural connection, career, travel), making organization decisions obvious.

### Assigning Parent Tasks and Sort Positions

During processing, I make deliberate choices about how each item fits into bigger goals and projects. Every task serves a larger purpose—"research microphone setups" belongs under YouTube equipment project → training videos goal → Mental life direction.

This builds a decision tree for future execution. When working on YouTube content, I want clear guidance about priorities, not re-evaluation. The processing hierarchy becomes the execution roadmap.

#### Which Life Direction Does This Task Belong To?

First decision: Time, Mental, Body, Social, or Finances. 90% have obvious homes once you think strategically. Work tasks → Time or Finances. Learning → Mental. Health → Body. Relationships → Social.

For ambiguous tasks, JTBD clarifies: "Buy standing desk" for back pain → Body. For work focus → Time. When multiple directions apply, pick primary motivation and move forward. Goal is good enough organization, not perfect categorization.

#### Is This a Standalone Task or Project Component?

**Standalone tasks:** Can execute immediately ("schedule dentist," "reply to email"). Assign parent and sort position—done.

**Project components:** Need containers ("launch podcast," "redesign website"). Create placeholder project with obvious next steps, save detailed breakdown for project-planning sessions.

Rule of thumb: If I can't visualize doing it in one session, it's probably a project. "Update LinkedIn" = task. "Build personal brand" = project.

The hierarchical system allows refactoring—tasks can become projects, projects can collapse to tasks as understanding evolves.

#### Setting Priority Within Parent Task Hierarchy

Final step: assign sort position (S0-S4) relative to siblings in the same container. This forces strategic thinking about trade-offs within each project.

**S0:** Critical path (1-3 per project max)  
**S1-S2:** Core work that advances the project  
**S3-S4:** Nice-to-have or someday-maybe

Sort positions are relative, not absolute. S0 in "Home Organization" might be less important than S3 in "Client Work," but when working on Home Organization, I want clear internal guidance.

This scales beautifully—never ranking hundreds of tasks globally, just siblings within containers. Manageable cognitive load, sharp strategic thinking.

### The JTBD Decision Framework for Task Organization

JTBD prevents random categorization and overthinking. It finds the sweet spot: enough strategic thinking for useful organization, not so much that processing becomes a bottleneck.

#### The Four Key Questions for Every New Task

Quick evaluation (15-30 seconds per task) ensures intentional decisions:

**1. What job am I hiring this task to do?** Focus on outcome, not location. "Research standing desks" = improve health/comfort.

**2. Which life direction does this job serve?** Health → Body. Learning → Mental. Efficiency → Time.

**3. Standalone job or part of larger project?** "Schedule dentist" = standalone. "Research standing desks" = part of "optimize home office."

**4. How important relative to other jobs in same area?** Becomes sort position within the container.

This creates a decision tree that handles virtually any captured task with consistent, strategic organization.



## Weekly Goal Reviews: Staying on Track with Quarterly Targets

Weekly reviews transform quarterly goals from wishful thinking into actual progress. Without regular check-ins, goals become forgotten January resolutions. With weekly reviews, they become living commitments with forward momentum.

In Notion, everything connects—weekly progress relates to daily tasks, supporting projects, and life directions. The same hierarchy that handles task management supports strategic goal tracking.

### The 8% Weekly Progress System

Simple math: 12 weeks per quarter = ~8% progress per week. Every Friday, I ask "Did I make meaningful progress this week?" and update the Progress field accordingly (8% normal, 10-12% exceptional, 3-5% minimal, 0% ignored).

This approach draws inspiration from [The 12 Week Year](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-12-Week-Year-Audiobook/1663702713) methodology, which advocates for shorter execution cycles instead of traditional annual planning. The core insight is that 12 weeks creates natural urgency and focus that annual goals often lack.

**Power is in regular accountability, not perfect measurement.** This quickly reveals which goals are on track versus falling behind. 30% progress in week 8 = problem requiring immediate attention.

**Friday ritual:** Review what I actually did (not intended), update percentages based on concrete progress.

**Monday connection:** Goals with low progress rates get prioritized in weekly planning. Creates natural feedback loop between strategic goals and tactical execution.

### Tracking Quarterly Goal Completion in Notion

Goals use the same database structure as daily tasks, with Type = "Goal" and additional tracking properties:

**Progress Field:** Updated weekly, shows quarterly completion percentage  
**Target Date:** Shared quarter-end date for all goals  
**Parent Relationship:** Each goal belongs to a life direction  

**Goal Progress Dashboard:** Custom view showing all five goals with progress percentages and supporting projects. Quick visual of what's thriving versus needing attention.

**Weekly Review Template:** Recurring Friday task with all five goals and space for progress notes. Keeps reviews consistent and prevents skipping harder-to-evaluate goals.

At quarter end, concrete data replaces vague "productive" feelings. Historical data informs better future goal-setting.

## Why This Notion System Beats Traditional Task Managers

Traditional task managers fail because they're built around two flawed assumptions: all tasks should be treated equally, and scheduling everything creates productivity. My Notion system flips both assumptions.

The difference isn't features—it's mental models. Most task managers impose their structure on your work. Notion lets you create structure matching how your brain thinks about getting things done. Result: natural-feeling system you actually use instead of abandoning after months.

### No More Task Avalanches: Flexible vs Rigid Structure

**My Notion system eliminates task avalanches by treating dates as the exception.** Most tasks live without action dates, organized by sort position. Only genuine deadlines get dates, keeping daily "active" lists to 3-7 manageable items.

**Flexible hierarchy replaces rigid categories.** Parent-child relationships can be reorganized as understanding evolves. "Research standing desk" moves between health/productivity/office setup as motivation becomes clear.

**Sort positions replace arbitrary deadlines.** Instead of "When should I do this?" (artificial urgency), ask "What order when working on this project?" Positions never pile up like calendar dates do.

**System adapts to you, not vice versa.** Work from active lists, navigate to projects, or focus on life directions based on energy and context. Gracefully handles inconsistency and priority shifts without guilt or massive cleanup sessions.

### Context and Hierarchy: What Makes This System Different

Traditional task managers treat tasks as isolated items. But tasks are part of projects → goals → life directions. This hierarchy provides strategic intelligence, not just organization.

**Context answers "why" and motivates action.** "Record video intro" in isolation = just another checkbox. Nested under "Cursor IDE Series" → "Training Video Production" → "Upload 7 training videos" → "Mental growth" = clear purpose and connection to bigger objectives.

**Key benefits:**
- **Motivation through connection:** See how small tasks serve larger purposes
- **Smart substitution:** Related tasks visible when plans change  
- **Natural priority evaluation:** Current goals versus interesting distractions
- **Flexible focus:** Zoom out (strategy) or in (tactics) as needed

Traditional managers optimize for task completion. This system optimizes for outcome achievement—progress on things that actually matter. Hierarchy distinguishes busy work from important work.

**Why it survives 1+ years while others lasted 2-3 months:** It's a strategic framework that includes task management, not just a task manager. Structure serves thinking, not vice versa.
