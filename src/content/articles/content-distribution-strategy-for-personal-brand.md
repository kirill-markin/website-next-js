This is my personal standard for distributing content across various platforms. I use this system to maintain consistency in sharing personal insights. While this is my personal workflow, I'm sharing it publicly as it might be useful for others building their content distribution strategy.

## Quick Start

Key principles of this distribution strategy:

1. Content Hierarchy: More complex content formats are preferred
   - Video > Article > Social Media Post
   - Each format requires its own distribution approach

2. Distribution Process:
   - Choose the primary platform for original content
   - Decide on content republishing strategy (exclusive vs cross-posting)
   - Utilize initial traffic sources if additional reach is justified
   - Update permanent content archives:
     - Complete Archive: Add all content links, maintain sorting
     - Short Profiles: Only add/update with best performing content

This document details each step of this process, providing specific platforms and guidelines for different content types.

## Original Content Placement

### Video Content Distribution

- YouTube main videos
  - When posting YouTube videos elsewhere, prefer sharing links to the original video rather than re-uploading, unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise
- Reddit, subreddit specific videos
  - When creating videos for specific subreddits, keep them exclusive and ensure the content clearly shows it was made specifically for that community

Initial traffic sources and permanent content links follow the same strategy as described in the Articles section above.

**Video to Text Content:**
For each distributed video, create a high-quality article version of the content and distribute it following the Text Content strategy described above. This maximizes the reach and allows the audience to consume the content in their preferred format.

### Text Content (Articles)

- Media publications (reach out to relevant journalists and industry publications)
- Reddit personal posts: [Profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kirmark)
  - Remember to approve after publication
- LinkedIn Articles: [Newsletter](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/articles-from-kirill-markin-7072862354891255810/)
- Personal website articles: [Articles](https://articles.kirill-markin.com)

**Content Republishing Strategy:**
When content is published in media outlets, keep it exclusive to respect the journalist's work and maintain good relationships. However, for content originally posted on Reddit or other platforms, always cross-post to LinkedIn Articles to maximize reach and engagement.

## Initial Traffic Sources

**Link Sharing Strategy:**
Share links to original content only when there's potential value in redirecting the audience (e.g., YouTube video links for channel subscriptions). For text content, prefer native posting on each platform rather than sharing links - this maximizes readership as users prefer consuming content directly within their platform of choice.

- LinkedIn feed posts (personal + company + contractor reposts)
  - When sharing external content, put the link in the first comment
- Personal Twitter feed: [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- BlueSky updates: [BlueSky](https://bsky.app)
- Company Twitter profile
- HackerNews submissions: [News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)
  - Follow [posting guidelines](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)
- IndieHackers posts (with images): [Profile](https://www.indiehackers.com/)
- Instagram stories and highlights
- Facebook stories
- Telegram stories
- Telegram channel updates with friends
- YouTube community posts
