# Hourly Billing Without Breaks: The Impact on Quality and Wellbeing

Many clients are familiar with the Pomodoro Method: 25 minutes of work, then a 5-minute break. Here's a new way to handle these breaks.

Don't charge for short breaks. Include them in your service for free. Use these breaks to really rest and breathe, not to count time. When you don't charge for them, your brain switches better, and you feel much more comfortable.

If you're worried about losing money, don't charge time. Instead, increase your hourly rate to cover focused work and needed breaks.

What do you think? Could this work in your consulting business?

P.S.: Thanks to [Lena Shakurova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lena-shakurova/), for recommending the Toggl service to me. Recently, I started working with more clients as usual as a Data Engineer and AI consultant, and I really like this time tracking service.
