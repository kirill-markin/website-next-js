# How to Fix Steam Game Downloads on the Steam Deck with Whisky on MacOS

## Issue

When using Whisky (a Wine wrapper) on macOS, you might encounter an issue where some Steam games download normally while others fail to download at all.

## Solution

1. Open Whisky application
2. Go to the "File" menu
3. Select "Kill All Bottles"
4. Restart Steam
5. Try downloading your games again - they should now download properly

This solution works by clearing any stuck Wine configurations that might be preventing proper game downloads through Steam.
