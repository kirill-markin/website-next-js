After six months of successfully using Cursor IDE for backend applications and data pipelines, I tried it for frontend development today. The difference was striking. While backend development with Cursor IDE has been smooth and efficient, frontend work with an actively maintained library proved to be significantly more challenging.

The reality hit when I discovered I was simultaneously dealing with three different versions of the same object type - one from the latest beta, another from the stable release, and a third from an older but still widely used version. These versions coexisted in the library without clear distinction or deprecation markers. In that moment of version chaos, I hit the undo button and thanked the existence of Git.

Turns out frontend libraries can throw you some real curveballs that you rarely see in backend work!
