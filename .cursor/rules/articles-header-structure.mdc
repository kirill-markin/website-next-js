# Article Header Structure Guide

This guide outlines the standard frontmatter structure for all articles on the website. Consistent frontmatter ensures proper metadata display in search results and optimal SEO performance.

## Required Frontmatter Fields

Every article must include these fields in the frontmatter (between `---` delimiters):

```markdown
---
keywords: [
  "keyword_1",
  "keyword_2"
]
title: "Translated Title in Target Language"
date: YYYY-MM-DD  # Same as original
description: "Translated description under 155 characters"
tags: [
    "translated-tag-1", 
    "translated-tag-2"
]
publish: true|false  # Same as original
thumbnailUrl: "/articles/image-filename.webp"  # Usually same as original
language: "target-language-code"  # e.g., "es" for Spanish
originalArticle:
  language: "en"
  slug: "original-english-slug"
---
```

## Field Guidelines

### `title`
- **Purpose**: Main heading; appears in browser tabs and search results
- **Format**: Use title case (capitalize main words)
- **Length**: 50-60 characters (appears fully in search results)
- **Content**: Include primary keyword near the beginning
- **Example**: `"Cursor IDE Setup: Optimizing Workflow for Large Projects"`

### `date`
- **Purpose**: Original publication date
- **Format**: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `2025-04-14`)
- **Notes**: Used for sorting and displaying publication date

### `description`
- **Purpose**: Summary displayed in search results
- **Format**: Plain text in quotes
- **Length**: 120-155 characters maximum (crucial to prevent truncation)
- **Content**: Must include primary keyword and clearly convey value
- **Notes**: This is the most important field for search result click-through
- **Example**: `"My practical workflow for using Cursor IDE with large codebases. How I combine test-driven development and voice commands for better productivity."`

### `tags`
- **Purpose**: Categorization for filtering and related content
- **Format**: Array of lowercase, hyphenated terms
- **Example**: `[productivity, ai-tools, development]`
- **Notes**: First tag is considered primary category

### `publish`
- **Purpose**: Controls visibility
- **Format**: Boolean (`true` or `false`)
- **Notes**: Only published articles appear on the site

### `thumbnailUrl`
- **Purpose**: Featured image for the article
- **Format**: Path to the image file in public directory
- **Example**: `"/articles/cursor-ide-rules-for-ai.webp"`
- **Notes**: Should be a webp format image for optimal performance

### `language`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the article's language
- **Format**: ISO language code (en, es, zh, ar, hi)
- **Example**: `"en"` (English), `"es"` (Spanish)
- **Notes**: Must be one of the supported languages

## Multilanguage Content Fields

For translated articles, these additional fields must be specified:

### For Original Articles (in English)

```markdown
translations:
  - language: "es"
    slug: "spanish-article-slug"
  - language: "zh"
    slug: "chinese-article-slug"
```

- **Purpose**: Lists all available translations of this article
- **Format**: Array of objects with language and slug properties
- **Notes**: This enables language switching and cross-linking between translations

### For Translated Articles (non-English)

```markdown
originalArticle:
  language: "en"
  slug: "original-english-slug"
```

- **Purpose**: Links back to the original article
- **Format**: Object with language and slug of the original article
- **Notes**: Creates bidirectional relationship with the original content

## Last Modified Date (Automatic)

The `lastmod` date for articles is now determined automatically from the file's last modification date in the filesystem. You no longer need to manually specify this field in the frontmatter.

- **Purpose**: Informs search engines when content was last updated
- **Implementation**: Automatically set based on the file's last modification timestamp
- **Benefits**: No need to manually update, always accurate

## Additional Optional Fields

These fields provide additional context but aren't required:

```markdown
type: "Article" | "Tutorial" | "Case Study"
publisher: "Kirill Markin"
achievementValue: "55,000"
achievementLabel: "Views"
isVideo: false
```

## Description Field Best Practices

The `description` field is critical for SEO and requires special attention:

1. **Optimal Length**: 120-155 characters (absolute maximum)
2. **Keywords**: Include primary keyword naturally in the first half
3. **Value Proposition**: Clearly state what the reader will gain
4. **Active Voice**: Use active rather than passive voice
5. **Uniqueness**: Each article needs a unique description
6. **No Clickbait**: Be accurate about the content
7. **No Markup**: Plain text only, no markdown formatting

## Examples of Effective Descriptions

✅ **Good**: "My personal framework for distributing content across platforms to maximize reach and engagement for personal branding. A practical system I've refined through experience."

✅ **Good**: "A quick solution for Mac users who can't download certain Steam games using Whisky. Simple steps to fix broken Steam downloads on macOS."

❌ **Too Long**: "In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through all the detailed steps of setting up Cursor IDE for large-scale projects, including test-driven development approaches, documentation practices, composer agent usage, and voice-based programming methods I've developed over years of professional coding experience."

❌ **Too Vague**: "Some thoughts about content distribution that might be helpful."

## File Storage Structure

Example:
```
src/content/articles/
├── cursor-ide-rules-for-ai.md                  # Original English
└── translations/
    ├── es/
    │   └── reglas-cursor-ide-para-ia.md        # Spanish translation
    └── zh/
        └── cursor-ide-guize.md                 # Chinese translation
```

## Implementation Process

1. When creating a new article, copy the frontmatter template
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Pay special attention to the description field length
4. For translations, ensure proper bidirectional references
5. Verify the files are placed in the correct directories
