# CV File Update Process

## Overview

The website hosts a PDF version of Kirill's resume/CV. This file needs to be updated whenever the CV is modified.

## Source Location

The master copy of the CV is located at:
```
/Users/kirill/_my_local/code-local/personal/cv-kirill-markin/data-engineer/cv-kirill-markin-data-engineer.pdf
```

## Update Process

1. When the CV needs to be updated:
   - Make changes to the master copy in the source location
   - Export/save the updated PDF
   - Copy the new PDF to the website's public directory

2. Update command:
   ```bash
   cp /Users/kirill/_my_local/code-local/personal/cv-kirill-markin/data-engineer/cv-kirill-markin-data-engineer.pdf public/data/
   ```

3. After copying, commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add public/data/cv-kirill-markin-data-engineer.pdf
   git commit -m "Update CV with latest version"
   git push
   ```

## Important Notes

- No other changes required - simply replacing the PDF file is sufficient
- The file name must remain consistent: `cv-kirill-markin-data-engineer.pdf`
- Ensure the PDF is optimized for web viewing (reasonable file size)
