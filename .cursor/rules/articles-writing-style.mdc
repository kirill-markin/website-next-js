# Business-Casual-Plus Writing Style Guide

Professional business-casual tone with personality. Avoids AI-sounding language while maintaining professionalism.

## Core Principles

1. **Professional but human** - Balance clarity with natural expression
2. **Slightly informal** - Cross formal lines occasionally for relatability
3. **Avoid AI patterns** - Eliminate AI linguistic patterns
4. **Personal touches** - Include experiences and light humor
5. **Conversational** - Write as if speaking to a respected colleague
6. **Globally accessible** - Clear English for non-native speakers

## Voice and Tone

✅ **Do**: Use first-person, vary sentence length, include mild colloquialisms, express genuine feelings, add occasional asides.

❌ **Avoid**: Hedging language, unnecessary qualifiers, academic detachment, formal transitions, robotic parallelism.

## Vocabulary

✅ **Do**: Explain jargon casually, use colorful verbs, natural metaphors, contractions, relevant references, simple words.

❌ **Avoid**: AI phrases ("It is worth noting"), thesaurus abuse, complex vocabulary, generic statements, perfectly balanced viewpoints.

## Structure

✅ **Do**: Start with conversational hooks, casual section headings, one-sentence paragraphs, rhetorical questions, brief anecdotes.

❌ **Avoid**: Symmetrical structure, parallel headings ("The Power of X, The Impact of Y"), predictable organization, unnecessary previews.

## AI Patterns to Avoid

- **Transitions**: "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"
- **Hedges**: "It is important to note"
- **Redundancy**: "Extremely important"
- **Qualifiers**: "Various studies show"
- **Intensifiers**: "Truly," "deeply"
- **Passive voice**: "It has been found that"
- **False balance**: Equal treatment of unequal viewpoints
- **Perfect symmetry**: Identical paragraph structures
- **Empty phrases**: "In today's fast-paced world"

## International Accessibility

**Do**: Simple sentences, explain idioms, global examples, define terms, active voice, short paragraphs, visual aids.

**Avoid**: Regional slang, complex clauses, wordplay, obscure references, fancy synonyms, compound-complex sentences.

**Examples**:
- **Bad**: "The utilization of sophisticated nomenclature invariably precipitates comprehension impediments."
- **Good**: "Using fancy words makes your content harder to read for people who learned English as a second language."

## Examples

**AI-Sounding (Avoid)**:
"In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, content distribution has become increasingly important for personal branding. Many experts agree that a strategic approach is necessary."

**Business-Casual-Plus (Use)**:
"I wasted a year posting content nobody saw before realizing most platforms aren't actually designed to help you reach new people. After some painful trial and error, I've sorted my content channels into three buckets: ones that actually bring in new eyeballs, ones that make me look credible when someone Googles me, and ones that just keep me connected with people who already know me."

## AI Word Red Flags

Words that scream "AI-generated":
- "Plethora"
- "Myriad of"
- "Facilitate"
- "Optimal/optimize"
- "Robust"
- "Leverage" (as verb)
- "Utilize" (instead of "use")
- "In terms of"
- "It goes without saying"
- "Needless to say"
- "Crafting" (unless actual crafts)
- "Curated" (unless art)
- "In the realm of"
- "Synergy"
- "State-of-the-art"
- "Engage with"
- "Impactful"
- "Best practices"

## SEO Keyword Optimization

Every article must incorporate SEO optimization while maintaining natural style.

### Keyword Requirements

1. **Frontmatter Keywords** - Include target keywords in frontmatter metadata
2. **Strategic Placement** - Keywords in: title, meta description, H1, subheadings, first 100 words, body text, image alt text, conclusion

**Do**: Use natural keyword flows, semantic variations, prioritize readability, answer keyword questions.

**Avoid**: Keyword stuffing, forced placement, sacrificing tone, awkward sentences, excessive repetition.

**Example**:
- **Bad**: "Looking for the best cursor rules for AI? These cursor rules for AI will improve your coding with AI."
- **Good**: "I wasted months wrestling with inconsistent AI coding results until I finally built a set of cursor rules that actually worked."

### SEO Headings Structure
1. **H1**: Main title with primary keyword
2. **H2**: Major sections with secondary keywords
3. **H3/H4/H5**: Subsections with related terms

**Process**: Research keywords → Add to frontmatter → Create keyword outline → Write value-focused draft → Review keyword placement → Check all locations → Confirm natural style

## Multilingual Guidelines

Support multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi) with consistent quality.

### Translation Principles
1. **Consistent Style** - Same Business-Casual-Plus style across languages
2. **Cultural Adaptation** - Adapt examples for cultural context
3. **Technical Accuracy** - Preserve technical meaning
4. **Natural Language** - Should sound natural to native speakers
5. **Appropriate Formality** - Maintain professional but approachable tone

### Keep in English
- Programming languages, frameworks, technical abbreviations
- Brand names, established technical terms developers know in English

### Translate
- User-facing features, concept explanations, benefits
- User actions, error messages

### Code Examples
- Keep code in English
- Translate only comments and user-visible text

### Language Adjustments
- **Spanish**: Break up long sentences, keep warm tone
- **Chinese**: More concise, clearer, fewer idioms
- **Arabic**: Respect formal structures while staying approachable
- **Hindi**: Find middle ground between formal/informal

### Review Process
1. Initial translation by fluent technical writer
2. Technical review by developer who speaks target language
3. Cultural/style review for natural tone
4. Final check against original
