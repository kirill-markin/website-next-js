# AGENTS.md

Guidance for working with this repository.

Modern personal website built with Next.js 15, migrated from Jekyll for performance.

**Git Workflow**: commit directly to `main`; production deploys happen only by pushing or merging to `main`, not by running Vercel CLI deploys.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev`: development server with ESLint and Turbopack
- `npm run build`: production build
- `npm run lint`: ESLint
- `npm run validate-metadata`: validate SEO metadata across all pages
- `npx tsx scripts/test-cache-headers.ts`: test cache headers
- `npm run analyze`: build with bundle analyzer (`ANALYZE=true`)

## BigQuery Analytics

- BigQuery contains the Google Search Console bulk export for `kirill-markin.com`, enabled on 2026-08-09. Use it for page and query clicks, search impressions, CTR, and average position; do not expect exported data from before this date.
- Use `npm run bigquery:query` with GoogleSQL on stdin for Search Console and SEO analysis; the implementation is `scripts/queryBigQuery.ts`.
- The ignored `.env.bigquery.local` stores the local key path, project ID, location, and per-query byte limit. The service-account JSON stays outside the repository.
- Never use or modify `gcloud` authentication for this integration, and never commit local configuration or credentials. If the configuration, key, or API access is unavailable, ask the user to provision or restore it instead of falling back to another Google identity.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, React 19 Server Components
- Tailwind CSS + CSS Modules
- Markdown via `gray-matter`, `remark`, `rehype`
- Path alias: `@/*` -> `./src/*`

## Core Principles

- Static generation first: pre-render content with `generateStaticParams`, keep aggressive caching (`86400` with `stale-while-revalidate` in `next.config.ts`), and avoid request-time server computation except for rare dynamic pages.
- Server Components first: use client components only where interactivity is required and keep browser JavaScript minimal.

## Project Structure

- `src/app/(default)/`: English static routes such as `/articles/`, `/services/`, `/meet/`, `/pay/`, `/dashboards/`
- `src/app/(i18n)/[lang]/`: localized dynamic routes
- `src/components/`: UI components
- `src/components/charts/`: client-side D3 chart components
- `src/content/articles/`: markdown articles plus `translations/[lang]/`
- `src/data/`: structured data (`services`, `media`)
- `src/lib/`: utilities including `localization.ts`, `weight.ts`
- `src/types/`: TypeScript types

## Multilingual Architecture

- In Next.js 15, route `params` are async: type them as `Promise<...>` and `await` them inside the page.
- Route groups:
  - `app/(default)/` for English static routes such as `/articles/`, `/services/`, `/meet/short/`
  - `app/(i18n)/[lang]/` for localized dynamic routes such as `/es/articulos/`, `/zh/zixun/`, `/ar/mawid/majani/`
- Arabic uses RTL via `dir="rtl"` in the `(i18n)` layout.
- Path mapping keeps logical routes aligned across languages:
  - `articles -> articulos -> zhishi -> maqalat -> gyan`
  - `services -> servicios -> zixun -> khadamat -> sevaen`
  - `meet/short -> reservar/breve -> yuyue/mianfei -> mawid/majani`
- Do not change existing localized route segments or URL slugs unless the user explicitly requests it; changing them can hurt SEO and break already indexed URLs.
- Key files:
  - `lib/localization.ts`: path segment mapping and translations
  - `(i18n)/[lang]/[segment]/page.tsx`: dynamic segment resolution
  - `(i18n)/[lang]/[segment]/[subsegment]/page.tsx`: nested routes
  - `(default)/*/page.tsx`: static English routes
- Before changing routes, check segment mappings in `localization.ts`.

## Content Structure

- Articles: `src/content/articles/` plus `translations/[lang]/`; markdown with frontmatter and bidirectional translation references
- Services: `src/data/servicesOther.ts`; category-based filtering
- Media: `src/data/mediaMentions.ts`; thumbnails are `520x297` (`16:9`), logos live in `public/logos/`
- Languages: `en`, `es`, `zh`, `ar`, `hi`; routes are pre-generated with `generateStaticParams`

## Development Patterns

- New pages:
  1. add the route in `(default)` or `(i18n)`
  2. update `lib/localization.ts` if the page is multilingual
  3. add `generateStaticParams` for dynamic routes
  4. implement `generateMetadata()`
- New content:
  1. create markdown with frontmatter
  2. add translations with bidirectional refs
  3. run `npm run validate-metadata`
- Before committing, run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm run validate-metadata` and fix failures.
- Best practices: default to Server Components, use CSS Modules for styling, and keep article `lastmod` explicit in frontmatter when content is materially updated.
- Translation workflow: use a structured process with key-term discussion; Chinese translations are reviewed with DeepSeek V3; keep URLs SEO-friendly in the target language.
- The reusable global LLM rules code block in Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex articles must stay byte-identical across all languages; keep the block tool-neutral, do not translate it, and update every copy together.

## Dashboards

Pages under `/dashboards/` render personal metrics as D3 charts. Weight data is fetched from the public AWS personal metrics endpoint before `next build`, written to `public/data/body-metrics-weight-series.csv`, and then baked into static HTML/Markdown from that local artifact. A daily GitHub Actions cron plus a Vercel Deploy Hook keeps the data fresh. See `src/lib/weight.ts`.
